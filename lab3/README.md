## Introduction

## What is CopilotKit?

CopilotKit is the simplest way to integrate production-ready Copilots into any product. It is an open-source AI copilot framework and platform that helps build deeply integrated in-app AI chatbots. It is easy to integrate powerful AI into your React apps.

## What is CopilotKit used for?

- **ChatBots💬**: Context-aware in-app chatbots that can take actions in-app.
- **CopilotTextArea📝**: AI-powered text fields with context-aware autocomplete and insertions.
- **Co-Agents🤖**: In-app AI agents that can interact with your app and users, powered by LangChain.

## What are the benefits of using CopilotKit?

### Bring context-aware AI to your app

- Connect your data to AI Assistant.
- Customize the behavior of your AI assistant.
- Enable your Copilot to take actions in the frontend.
- Auto-generate suggestions in the chat window based on real-time application state.
- Copilot Textarea for AI-powered autosuggestions.

### Backend Actions & Agents

- Use any LLM model to power your AI assistant.
- Enable backend actions and agents in your Copilot.

### Customize the look and feel of the built-in Copilot UI components

- Embed custom UI components in the Copilot window.
- Built-in Copilot UI components.
- Fully customize your Copilot's UI from the ground up using headless UI.

## What are the features of CopilotKit?

- **Seamless AI Integration**: CopilotKit offers plug-and-play components.
- **Contextual Awareness**: Access real-time, user-specific data, enhancing their relevance and effectiveness.
- **Actionable Intelligence**: CopilotKit enables copilots to perform actions on behalf of users, streamlining workflows and improving efficiency.
- **CoAgents Integration**: Seamless integration with LangChain and LangGraph agents.
- **Generative UI**: Render fully custom React components within the chat interface.
- **AI-Enabled Text Editing**: AI-powered text editing features, including autocompletions and insertions, serving as a drop-in replacement for any textarea.

## What are the limitations of using CopilotKit?

- **Framework Compatibility**: Primarily designed for React applications.
- **Customization Complexity**: Achieving deep customization may require significant effort. Implementing a fully custom headless UI involves using hooks like `useCopilotChat`.
- **AI Model Dependencies**: Performance and capabilities are influenced by the underlying AI models. Limitations inherent to these models, such as handling specific languages or domain-specific knowledge, can affect effectiveness.
- **Resource Requirements**: Integrating AI functionalities can be resource-intensive, potentially impacting application performance.
- **Data Privacy and Security**: Incorporating AI copilots involves processing user data, which raises concerns about data privacy and security. Implement robust measures to protect sensitive information and comply with relevant data protection regulations.

## What are the alternatives to CopilotKit?

## How do I get started with CopilotKit?

Follow the instructions to get started with CopilotKit: [CopilotKit Tutorial](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/tutorials/ai-todo-app/overview)

## Next Steps

After getting started with CopilotKit, you can explore the following advanced features:

1. **Add suggestions to your copilot** using the [`useCopilotChatSuggestions`](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/reference/hooks/useCopilotChatSuggestions) hook.

   Open `components/TasksList.tsx` and add the following code:

   ```typescript
   import { useCopilotChatSuggestions } from "@copilotkit/react-ui";

   export function TasksList() {
     const { tasks } = useTasks();
     useCopilotChatSuggestions(
       {
         instructions: "Suggest the most relevant next actions.",
         minSuggestions: 1,
         maxSuggestions: 2,
       },
       [tasks],
     );
   }
   ```

   It should suggest relevant actions based on the tasks in the list.

2. **Add an initial assistant message to your chat window** (for more info, check the documentation for [`<CopilotPopup />`](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/reference/components/chat/CopilotPopup)).

   Open `app/page.tsx`:

   ```typescript
   import { CopilotKitCSSProperties, CopilotPopup, CopilotSidebar } from "@copilotkit/react-ui";

   <div
     style={
       {
         height: `100vh`,
         "--copilot-kit-primary-color": "red",
       } as CopilotKitCSSProperties
     }
   >
     <CopilotSidebar
       labels={{
         title: "To Do Assistant",
         initial: "Hi! 👋 How can I assist with your list?",
       }}
     />
   </div>
   ```

   It will change the color of the chat window to red and display the initial message "Hi! 👋 How can I assist with your list?".

3. **Dive deeper into the useful [`useCopilotChat`](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/reference/hooks/useCopilotChat) hook**, which enables you to set the system message, append messages, and more.

   Open `components/AddTodo.tsx` and replace the following code:

   ```typescript
   import { useCopilotChat } from "@copilotkit/react-core";
   import { Role, TextMessage } from "@copilotkit/runtime-client-gql";

   export function AddTodo() {
     const [title, setTitle] = useState("");
     const { addTask } = useTasks();
     const { appendMessage } = useCopilotChat();

     const handleAddTask = () => {
       addTask(title);
       appendMessage(
         new TextMessage({
           content: `Added task ${title}. Is there anything else?`,
           role: Role.Assistant,
         }),
       );
       setTitle("");
     };
   }
   ```

   Add a task to the list. It will append a message to the chat window: "Added task {title}. Is there anything else?".

4. **Implement autocompletion using the [`<CopilotTextarea />`](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/reference/components/CopilotTextarea) component**.

   Open `components/AddTodo.tsx` and replace the following code:

   ```typescript
   import { CopilotTextarea } from "@copilotkit/react-textarea";

   <form onSubmit={(e) => e.preventDefault()}>
     <div className="flex items-center mb-4">
       <CopilotTextarea
         value={title}
         onChange={(e) => setTitle(e.target.value)}
         placeholder="Add a new todo..."
         className="flex-1 mr-2 bg-muted text-muted-foreground rounded-md px-4 py-2"
         autosuggestionsConfig={{
           textareaPurpose: "the title of the task",
           chatApiConfigs: {},
         }}
       />
       <Button type="submit" disabled={!title} onClick={handleAddTask}>
         Add
       </Button>
     </div>
   </form>
   ```

   This will enable autocompletion for the task title in the text area.
